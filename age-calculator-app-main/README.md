It was a very fun project for my first "biggest" JS website.
It was not easy for me but but.. So I practise and learnt a lot of:
FLEX, JS and one of the most important (I think..) is about the RESPONSIVE site (relative unit: % uv vh).. and that */!% circle... sometimes egg.. :D
I know I need to learn lot of more and more.. and I want to learn.
Thank you frontendmentor.io :)
